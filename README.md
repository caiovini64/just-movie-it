## üìÉ About

Just Movie It is an app of movie recommendations, where the user can see movie lists and see selected movie details.

This project was recreated several times while I learning clean architecture.

## üìê Architecture
   The project structure is divided into four main layers:
   - **Domain:** The heart of the application, all the business rules and entities.
   - **Data:** Here is the external connection through use-case implementations.
   - **Infra:** Here is the HTTP client where the response from the external connection is handled.
   - **UI:** The application interface.
