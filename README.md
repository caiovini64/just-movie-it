## üìê Architecture
   The project structure is divided into three main layers:
   - Domain: The heart of the application, all the business rules and entities.
   - Data: Here is the external connection through use-case implementations.
   - UI: The application interface.

  The application's data flow is simple and seeks **SOLID** principles.

  **Page:** The responsibility of the page is to get the user actions to send to the presenter and show the presenter's feedback.
  
  **Presenter:** The presenter's responsibility is to receive the user actions from the page, obtain the use case data, and send the data to the page.
  
  **Usecase:** The use case is the business logic of the application.
  
  **Client:** The client's responsibility is to make the external connection with the API and return the data.
